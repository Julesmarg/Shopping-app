# Shopping-app
Ok where to start... this one is a doozy,

For this project I wanted to experiment a little in Figma, which led me to doing the entire project in figma. Becuase I wanted to focud my attention on making annimated assets, I used a shopping templete for free off of the figma site. I changed the header and modified it to include more room for movement, which i will break down.

The first annimation I wanted to tackle was the search bar. To do this I created several componets and turned them into a variable that I would then use smart animattion to create the smooth bounce.

Next we see that once I click on a bag, and add it to my cart, the cart number changes in the upper right corner. This little detail was nearly the end of me. In reality, the detail is wonky, becuase I had to set it as a delayed changes and not something triggered, I will change even if i don'y add the bag to my cart. But for the sake of my sanity lets pretend it works.

From here you can see all the items in your cart, as well as change the quanity or return back to shopping aka the home page.

Lastly we are taken through a relatively routine check-out process. I tried ot make an apple pay option appear as well as the Face-ID and conformation but after what felt like ages fighting with figma i decided to try another route. Once you continue through filling out your information the last thign you see if the confirmation screen as well as a map of your order status. 

Overall this project was pretty challenging, but a good challenge. Definitly feel that my figma chops are meatier.
